# Window-Bombing-Malware
Window bombing malware is a malicious software that floods the screen with multiple pop-up windows, overwhelming the user and hindering normal device usage by saturating the interface with unwanted windows.
The presented script aims to simulate the behavior of opening multiple pop-up windows that play a specific YouTube video upon detecting user interactions with the keyboard or mouse. Additionally, the random movement of the mouse cursor is programmed to hinder the user's ability to close the pop-up windows.
## Event Detection:
The code is designed to detect any user interaction, whether it's through the keyboard or mouse. Pressing a key or moving the mouse activates the script, triggering the opening of multiple pop-up windows.
## YouTube Video Pop-Ups:
The opened pop-up windows contain a link directing to a specific video on YouTube. By opening multiple instances of these windows, an attempt is made to overload the system's capacity and hinder the user's interaction with their device.
## Random Mouse Cursor Movement:
To add an additional layer of obstruction, the script implements random movement of the mouse cursor. This is done to impede the user's ability to close the pop-up windows, as the cursor continuously moves in different directions unpredictab
